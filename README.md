# File::Directory::Bubble

A file-removal tool that

- optionally recurses deletion up the directory tree until it hits a non-empty directory;
- allows for dry runs, only showing you what would be deleted.

## Installation

With [zef](https://github.com/ugexe/zef):

- just running `zef install File::Directory::Bubble` should work once the module has been indexed;
- or clone this repo and issue `zef install <path-to-cloned-repo>`;
- or clone, `cd` into the repo, and `zef install .`.
